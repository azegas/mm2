What the hell. Integration with telegram.

Go to Telegram and search for the BotFather.

Use the command /newbot to create a new bot and get your BOT_TOKEN.

For CHAT_ID - Open Telegram and search for your bot using its username (the one you created with BotFather).
Start a chat with your bot by sending any message (e.g., "Hello").

Then visit - https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_BOT_TOKEN>/getUpdates

Look for the chat object in the JSON response. Your CHAT_ID will be listed there, typically as chat.id.

Run the script, below, the stuff you give to it will be sent to telegram chat. WTFFF!!!!

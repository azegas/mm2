## How it works with socket.io

Backend:
- continuous process on the backend to fetch the data (cronjob)
- cronjob fetches every minute or so during 05:00 - 07:00 and 17:00 - 22:00
- when the cron job finished, usually it stores the results in a .json file

Frontend:
- on the frontend, we have a flask app
- flask app in itself has some socketio functions that READ data from the files
- We tell, with the help of javascript, how often to read the data of those files and then update the page with it
